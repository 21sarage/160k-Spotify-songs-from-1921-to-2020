# 160k-Spotify-songs-from-1921-to-2020

We used the _songsAnalysis.ipynb_ Jupyter Notebook as an example of how to implement a Data Science pipeline, through multiple stages:
- data collection
- data cleanup
- data visualization and statistical analysis
- statistical test (t-test)
- clustering (using the k-means algorithm)
- use of a predictive method (Linear Regression and Logistic Regression)

We focused on analyzing and predicting the popularity of the songs in the dataset (imported by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fcpercival/160k-spotify-songs-sorted?select=data.csv)), studying the musical features that compose each track.
